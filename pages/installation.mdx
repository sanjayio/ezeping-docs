# Installation

Installing ezePing in your SaaS is very straightforward. It is just like calling any other external REST API endpoint. For authorisation, it expects a Bearer token. The API Key can be found in your [dashboard](https://www.ezeping.com/dashboard/api-key) and check the sub pages for examples. 

Apart from the authorisation, the API expects 2 other things in the body:
- Category: A category to which this event has to be associated to. 
- Fields: Containing a generic object, with your payloads in key-value pairs in valid JSON format.
